/*Problem:
Write a function that checks whether a person can watch an R-rated movie. One of the following two conditions is required for admittance: the person is at least 17 years old or they have parental supervision. The function accepts two parameters, age and isSupervised. Return a boolean that shows whether the person can enter the theater.

Examples
acceptIntoMovie(14, true) ➞ true
acceptIntoMovie(14, false) ➞ false
acceptIntoMovie(17, false) ➞ true
*/

/* Pseudocode:
write a function
Inputs is age which is a number  and isSupervised which is a boolean 
Output is a boolean that is true or false 
uses an if else statement
if age >= 17 or isSupervised true
then admittance is true 
if age < 17 or isSupervised false
then admittance is false
*/

function admittance(age, isSupervised)
  {
    if (age >=17 || isSupervised === true)
    {return true}
   else if (age <17 || isSupervised === false)
    {return false}
}

console.log(admittance(14, true)); //should be true
console.log(admittance(14, false)); //should be false
console.log(admittance(17, false)); //should be true
