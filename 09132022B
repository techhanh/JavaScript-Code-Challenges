/*Practice Problem
Help count the number of points for a soccer team. Create a function that takes 3 parameters:  the number of wins, ties, and losses. The function returns the total number of points the soccer team has obtained so far.
wins get 3 points
Ties get 1 point
losses get 0 points
*/

/*Pseudocode
create a function
has 3 Input which is are all numbers (wins, ties, losses)
output is a number that represents the total - return total of points
for example:
5 wins  - 3 points for each win is 5 * 3 = 15 winpoints 
3 ties - 1 points for each win is 3 * 1 = 3 tiepoints
5 losses - 0 points for each win is 5 * 0 | 0 lossespoints //this can be omitted since the total points will not change regardless of loss
 totalpoints = winspoints + tiespoints
*/

function totalPoints(wins, ties, losses){
  let total = 0;
  let winsPoints = wins * 3;
  let tiesPoints = ties * 1;
  total = winsPoints + tiesPoints;
  return total 
}

console.log(totalPoints(5, 3, 5));
