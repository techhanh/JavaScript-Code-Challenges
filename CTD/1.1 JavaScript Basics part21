//Question 6. Conditional 2 - You are given a randomNumber generator that will create a number between 1 and 3 in the randomNumber variable (do not change this code). 
//Create a condtional where 
//if the randomNumber variable is equal to 1 set theAnswer variable to "perhaps it is so", 
//if randomNumber is equal to 2 set theAnswer variable to "yes, definitely" and 
//if randomNumber is equal to 3 set theAnswer to "no, never"

/// DO NOT TOUCH THE CODE HERE - it is creating a random number between 1 and three for you to test against
const randomNumber = Math.floor((Math.random() * 3) + 1);

///// WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW 
let theAnswer = "";
if (randomNumber === 1) {
theAnswer = "perhaps it is so";
}
 else if (randomNumber === 2) {
theAnswer = "yes, definitely";
 } else if (randomNumber === 3) {
theAnswer = "no, never";
 }
console.log("Answer 6: " + theAnswer);



// QUESTION 7. Given the variable x, using JS round it to it's nearest two decimal number on the line immediately below the line that initially sets the x variable. 

let x = 21.45729;
function roundNumber(x) {
 return x.toFixed(2);
}
console.log("Answer 7: " + roundNumber(21.45729));



// QUESTION 8. Given the variable y as a string, convert it to the an integer with no decimal places. Round down. 

let y = Math.floor("15.3522");
console.log("Answer 8: " + y);


//QUESTION 9. Without removing the string delimiters from var1 (the " "), add var1 and var2 so that they add up to 42 as an integer and are stored in the variable var3.

const var1 = "24";
const var2 = 18;

//code here
// let var3 = Math.floor(var1) + var2; //Math.floor moves it to the next lower integer

let var3 = parseInt(var1) + var2; //parseInt changes it to an integer number
console.log("Answer 9: " + var3);



//QUESTION 10 - MODULUS/REMAINDER and some other JS. If the variable var4q is divisible by exactly 6 then have the variable var4a set to the string "It is divisible." If it is not divisible by 6 then set it to the string. "I am not divisible."

const var4q = 42;
if (var4q % 6 === 0) {
var4a = "It is divisible."
} else {
var4a = "I am not divisible."
}
console.log("Answer 10: " + var4a);
